Creating software naturally involves writing your source code.

## Supports
- [Creating software with Clojure]
## Done when
- Your tests pass, with good coverage

## Otherwise
- [Create source files with appropriate namespaces]
- Bring resources into your classpath
- Create or modify test files and require the source namespaces
- Open a REPL
- Bring your source namespace into your REPL
- Consider alternating between your test and target namespaces,
  developing your tests and core logic as you go.

- Manage state
- Interoperate with imported resources
