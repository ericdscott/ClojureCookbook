# ClojureCookbook
These are descriptions of a set of recipes for common tasks relating
to Software Development with Clojure, organized through what is
hopefully a fairly systematic task decomposition of the software
creation process.

Each node in this cook book should be dedicated to a specific kind of
goal and discuss:
- Why would you pursue this goal? (what larger goals does this support?)
- When are you done?
- How might you confirm that you are done?
- What states might you be in that fall short of being done, and what
  can you do about that?
  
The entry point for this is [To Create Software with Clojure].

Contributions are most welcome! See [CONTRIBUTING.md].
