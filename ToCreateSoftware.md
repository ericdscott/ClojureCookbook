# How to Create Software with Clojure

Clojure is a very expressive medium with which to create software.

Watch this space for pointers to some good articles on that.

## Done when:

You have created and published a well-tested and well-documented project in Clojue.

### Some ways to confirm this

- If you've published to a git repo, you should be able to clone the project and [run its tests].
- If you've published a jar to [clojars](https://clojars.org/), you should be able to find it using clojar's search feature.


## Otherwise
- Create a clojure project
- Manage dependencies for your project
- Develop your code
- Write and execute tests with good coverage
- Write clear documentation
- Publish your code and other artifacts
