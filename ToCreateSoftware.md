# How to Create Software with Clojure

Clojure is a very expressive medium with which to create software.

Watch this space for pointers to some good articles on that.

## Done when:

You have created and published a well-tested and well-documented project in Clojue.

### Some ways to confirm this

- If you've published to a git repo, you should be able to clone the project and [run its tests].
- If you've published a jar to [clojars](https://clojars.org/), you should be able to find it using clojar's search feature.


## Otherwise
- [Create a clojure project]
- [Manage dependencies for your project]
- [Develop your code]
- [Write and execute tests with good coverage]
- [Write clear documentation]
- [Publish your code and other artifacts]
- [Maintiain your project moving forward]
